    About me:
</h1>

<p>I have been studying web development for a number of weeks now. I started by learning basic html and css to create simple websites.
I began learning javascript and jquery next, which openned new doors for me in terms of what was possible in web design. I built working
    applications using these languages which you can see in the
    <a href="#/projects">projects</a> section of this website. I then began studying angular js
    and have built this website using the core principles I have learned.
